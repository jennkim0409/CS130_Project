## Initial Setup
### Frontend
1. cd into frontend folder
2. run "npm i" (installs dependencies)

### Backend
1. install express
2. install nodemon
3. install mongoose

## Option #1
1. Open up a terminal in the outermost directory of this project (outside frontend/backend directories)
2. Run "./run_proj.sh"

## Option #2
The above option is probably preferred by frontend, since it hides the backend logs.
but if you want to see both the frontend & backend logs, do this:
1. Open up a terminal, cd into frontend, run "npm start"
2. Open up another terminal, cd into backend, then run "npm run dev"
